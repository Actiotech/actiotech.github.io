&lt;p&gt;Every Product company on this planet goes through this decisive moment — the moment when you have to choose the right project management software. It’s funny how this little decision is fundamental for the whole business; you choose one little program that will be the backbone of your workflow for years. Yes, you heard right — for years. Do you have any idea how hard it is to change people’s habits, especially in the workplace?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it — sooner or later you will have to make that same decision. I can’t stress enough how important this decision will be. There are tons of project management solutions on the market, but we decided to go with Atlassian JIRA. Why is that? Here are our top five picks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-it-s-mature-and-proven:9126290695588bfdc87d48e206a78497&#34;&gt;1 It’s mature and proven&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JIRA is an issue tracker developed by Atlassian in 2002. Atlassian’s customer list is extremely impressive and it includes over 40,000 companies of all shapes and sizes. JIRA Agile debuted six years ago and since then has developed as a major offering for agile-driven teams. There are lots of people familiar with the tool, and the community is large and active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-it-s-extremely-customizable:9126290695588bfdc87d48e206a78497&#34;&gt;2 It’s extremely customizable&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it’s used in different industries for different purposes (issue tracking, project management, support), JIRA has evolved into a feature-rich, highly customizable solution. Issue types, fields, states and workflows have sensible defaults that can be changed to suit your needs. JIRA Agile, popular JIRA addon, provides Scrum and Kanban support out of the box. Nevertheless, we were able to customize JIRA to suit our needs by creating custom issue schemes and workflows. It works like a charm, is really powerful and it just helps us a lot in our everyday development struggles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-powerful-product-family:9126290695588bfdc87d48e206a78497&#34;&gt;3 Powerful product family&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An issue tracker is simply not enough to meet modern software development management requirements. We were also looking for a wiki (Confluence), CI (Bamboo) and CVS (Stash) management tools. Having a whole ecosystem of integrated tools brings long term benefits. The ability to create and track issues from Confluence pages, view Git commits and build status related to a particular JIRA issue works out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-extensibility:9126290695588bfdc87d48e206a78497&#34;&gt;4 Extensibility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JIRA is an enterprise solution and as such comes with powerful integration possibilities. We have integrated couple of marketplace plugins as well to make our DevOps process more streamlined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-it-s-cheap-for-small-teams:9126290695588bfdc87d48e206a78497&#34;&gt;5 It’s cheap for small teams&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JIRA and JIRA Agile cost only  $10 one-time payment (on-premise license) for the first 10 users, which gives startups a great value-to-cost ratio. The pricing model is transparent and available online, so you can easily predict the necessary investments as your organization grows&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DevOps</title>

&lt;p&gt;We’re looking for a full-time devops engineer to join our team and help maintain, grow,and automate our &lt;a href=&#34;https://view26.com&#34;&gt;Product&lt;/a&gt; infrastructure. It’s a big job with a lot of
responsibility, but it’s also a fun job with a lot of freedom!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The job has two simple goals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep everything running and running well (24x7) as part of our Product Support Team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make it quick and easy for developers to deploy production-ready code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this job well, you’ll need to be part programmer, part Linux system admin, and part DBA. As a programmer, you must know system-scripting language (Bash, Perl,
etc.). You’ll also have to learn Go if you don’t already know it, but it’s easy to learn. As a Linux sysadmin, you must know Debian/Ubuntu and basic system maintenance. As
a DBA, you must know basic MySQL/NoSQL maintenance. In general, this job will require a lot of creativity and creation, unless you happen to know and can adapt ready-made solutions to our specific needs and requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work is challenging, but that’s why it’s also fun and rewarding! Plus, our team is small, so you and your work will have a large impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;skills-requirements:9483d6b06afbc29c2ebcaf5d259781d2&#34;&gt;Skills &amp;amp; Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BTech/MCA/Degree in CS or Electronics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent knowledge of a system scripting language (Bash, Perl, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent written and verbal English.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to work independently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Willing to work in Night shifts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Willing and able to fix problems whenever they occur.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
